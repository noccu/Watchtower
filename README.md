Watchtower is a browser extension that adds informational tags to users on internet platforms through custom, auto-updatable lists created and curated by the community. Lists can be made for any topic or goal. Users are tracked by ID wherever possible. Watchtower works on ~~all modern browsers~~ at least chrome.
