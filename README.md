Watchtower is a browser extension that adds informational tags to users on internet platforms through custom, auto-updatable lists created and curated by the community. Lists can be made for any topic or goal. Users are tracked by ID wherever possible. Watchtower works on ~~all modern browsers~~ at least chrome.

> **This project is still in pre-release and available for testing and feedback only.**

# Supported platforms

# Install
Currently, you need to enable developer mode and load the extension unpacked from a folder.  
You also require an up to date browser (early 2024) as the code relies on recent APIs.
