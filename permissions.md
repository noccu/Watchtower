# General permissions
- `storage`: Saving lists, settings, and other extension data.
- `unlimitedStorage`: In case you save many, many very large lists. Also possible future functionality.
- `contextMenus`: To allow reporting through right-click menu.

# Host permissions
- `file:///`: Use local lists from your drives. (Might require allowing file access separately)
- `<all_urls>`: Use lists from and report to any source (host).

# Site permissions
These provide functionality for that platform by allowing script injection.
