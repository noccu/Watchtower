# General permissions
- `storage`: Saving lists, settings, and other extension data.
- `unlimitedStorage`: In case you save many, many very large lists. Also possible future functionality.
- `contextMenus`: To allow reporting through right-click menu.
- `downloads`: To allow exporting lists, which "downloads" it as a file.

# Host permissions
- `file:///`: Use local lists from your drives. (Might require allowing file access separately)

# Site permissions
These provide functionality for that platform by allowing Watchtower's scripts to be loaded in the page.
