# The reporting process

While list management can be done in any way, Watchtower intends to provide a standardized mechanism for reporting content to the list curators for review. This mechanism is still being worked on and may undergo large changes in response to feedback early on.  
It should be noted that reports are handled by each list's curators and Watchtower holds no control or responsibility over this.

**Currently no data is sent anywhere as that functionality is not yet implemented.**

## How to report
When on a supported platform, right-click a link to the user's profile page. On platforms that replace the context menu, you can shift + right-click. Generally speaking, any link that includes the username or id should work, but this could depend on the platform. A small window or panel will pop up showing the report's details. Please check them over to ensure you are reporting the right user. Select the list to report the user to, configure the options as needed, provide optional information if relevant, then click the report button.

## Report options
- `Local only`: Do not send any report data, only add to your local reports. This is mainly intended for list building, or if you wish to manually report a large number of users at once.
- `Request removal`: **Not implemented.** Report an existing user as being wrongfully added to the list. Further details should be provided.
